# SudokuSolver
A C# Sudoku Solver Implementation 

Puzzles and Solution files are located in the top level [Puzzles](./Puzzles) directory.

## Overview
Sudoku is a number placement puzzle based on a 9x9 grid with several given numbers.  The object is to place the numbers 1 to 9 in the empty squares so that each row, each column, and each 3x3 box contains the numbers 1-9 only once. 
The objective of this exercise is to develop a program that solves Sudoku puzzles by filling in the empty blanks without violating any of the constraints defined in the rules, above.  Please implement your solution in Java or C# (as instructed by your recruiter or hiring manager).  

## Requirements
- Your solution should properly orient itself around OO/SOLID principles.
-	Please implement your own solution.  Referencing a library like SudokuSolver.dll or SudokuSolver.js is not acceptable.  The inclusion of libraries or packages for testing is acceptable and should be documented.
-	You will have to read in the starting board from a text file.  There are five starting boards included with these instructions.  In these definition files, an ‘X’ represents an open cell and a number indicates a fixed starting value for a cell.
-	The contents of completed puzzles [“the solution”] should be output to a new file.  The name of the completed file should follow the format of {0}.sln.txt where {0} is the name of the original input file.
-	Include all supporting materials such as unit tests and/or documentation in your submission.

## Considerations
-	This exercise is not timed and you are not rewarded for a fast turnaround.  This exercise should be treated as any development task – code should be clean, robust and production-worthy.  Ultimately, you should consider “Would I commit this to a repository for all to see?”
-	The conventions, standards, and best-practices of the language/technology you are utilizing should be adhered to.
-	Thoughtful object-oriented design paradigms should be considered.  Be prepared to defend your design choices and/or the details of your implementation.
-	The solution should solve the given puzzles.  In the event that a puzzle cannot be reasonably solved by your algorithm, the application should fail gracefully.

## Deliverables
Your submission should be submitted as a link to a GitHub or GitLab repository - both services offer free accounts for hosting repositories.  The repository should include the five original puzzles and their respective solutions in addition to your source code and any supporting material.
